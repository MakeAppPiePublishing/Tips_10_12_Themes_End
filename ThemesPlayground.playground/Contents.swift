//:# Xcode 11.4 Goodies
//:## SwiftUI `List` now works in Xcode Playgrounds
//: Prior to Xcode 11.4, `List` did not work in *Swift Playgrounds* for Xcode. It had a very bad retain cycle error which would eventually crash the system. There was a workaround with `ForEach` but not a great one. But it now works great as you can test below.
